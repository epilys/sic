## In a nutshell

- No Javascript necessary. An HTML5 compliant browser is enough; it even runs on [`w3m`, the text web browser](http://w3m.sourceforge.net/).
- Lightweight, requires only a `python3` environment and stores its database in a `sqlite3` file.
- Can be deployed with WSGI compatible servers (Apache/NGINX) or even `django`'s development server if need be.

### ✒️ Forum features

- Posts can be text and/or URLs.
- Posts can optionally have any number of tags.
- Latest stories RSS and Atom feeds are provided.
- Post and comment text content support [commonmark Markdown syntax](https://commonmark.org/).
- Posts and comments can only be upvoted. Support for flagging (downvoting) will be added soon.
- Posts can be pinned to the top with a time limit or indefinitely.

### 🏷️ Tag and 🗂️ Aggregation system

- Tags can optionally have any number of parent tags (but cycles are not allowed)
- Tags can optionally be organised in _Aggregations_, which are collections of tags with a common theme. A user's frontpage can be either all stories or their subscribed aggregations' stories.
- Aggregations can optionally be private, public or discoverable by other users.
- Aggregations can be set as "default" by moderators. New users are subscribed to default aggregations.
- Users can create their own aggregations at any time.
- Tags, users and domains can be excluded from an Aggregation via _exclude filters_.

### 🔍 Search system

- Comments and posts are automatically indexed in a separate `sqlite` database file using the `fts5` (full text search) virtual table extension.
- Posts with URLs can optionally have their remote content fetched and indexed with a `django` management command (e.g. from within a cron job).

### 🎛️ Permission and moderation system

- Users can be inactive, active or banned.
- Moderators can set the number of days for which an account is considered new. New accounts cannot add tags or perform other potentially destructive actions.
- Public moderation log.

### 📨 Notification and email system

- Mentioning other users in comments notifies them.
- Users can choose when they receive each kind of notification via email
- Users can optionally enable a weekly digest email.

### 👥 Account system

- Users can either freely sign-up or have to be invited to.
- Users can optionally request for an invitation (this feature can be turned off).
- Users can save any story, comment to their bookmarks along with personal notes and export them at any time.
- Users can add personal metadata in their profile, including an avatar.
- Users can add "hats" to their account, which are decorations that can optionally be added to a comment. For example a moderator user wanting to comment as a moderator and not as a user would use a hat.
- Users have a personalised Atom or RSS feed that shows only their subscriptions.

### 🌐 Web standards

- Posted URLs are notified with [`webmention`](https://www.w3.org/TR/webmention/).
- Users can be retrieved with [`webfinger`](https://webfinger.net/).
